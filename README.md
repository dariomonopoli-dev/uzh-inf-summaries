# UZH Informatics Summaries  
These are my personal notes, summaries, and cheatsheets from the **Bachelor‚Äôs in Informatics at the University of Zurich (UZH)**.  
I studied **Software Systems (Major)** and **Computational Science (Minor)**.  

Most material is based on lecture slides, tutorials, and exercises, but sometimes also from summaries I got from others and edited.  

I grouped everything by year and semester: **Assessment Year**, **2nd Year**, and **3rd Year**.


## üìú Credits  

Some of these summaries were not written by me, I found them on Uniboard and were kindly uploaded by other UZH students.

Credits go to the original authors, thank you for making them available.

If you are the original author and want me to remove your summary, please contact me.
