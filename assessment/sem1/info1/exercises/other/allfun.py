#A digital gray-scale image can be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the values for one row of the image and where each value can take on a number between 0 (pure black) and 255 (pure white). Below you can some examples. Example 1 draws out a picture of the upper case letter "B" in dark gray (value 50) on a white (value 255) background. Example 2 shows a white-to-black gradient going from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.

# Your task is to implement two functions: invert, which inverts the colors of an image, and flip_vertical, which flips the picture vertically.

# Inverting a picture means changing dark values to light values and light values to dark values. In our case, 255 would need to be changed to 0, 254 to 1, 253 to 2 and so on, all the way to changing 0 to 255. See Example 3 below for how Example 1 is inverted.

If there's an un-even number of rows, the middle row stays where it is. See Example 4 for the vertically flipped gradient of Example 2.

# Implement the following recursive sorting algorithm in a function my_sort, which takes a list l as a parameter. Assume that the list l contains any number of positive and/or negative numbers. Assume that the list contains no duplicate values. For this task, you need to precicely follow the instructions in the algorithm description one by one to implement a correct solution. Read the steps carefully to ensure that your implementation will be correct. The following steps need to be implemented in the function body of my_sort:

# Step 1: Check if l is empty. If that's true, return an empty list.
# Step 2: Assign the first element in l to a variable called middle.
# Step 3: Create two empty lists and assign them to variables called smaller and larger.
# Step 4: Begin a for loop that iterates over the elements in l, starting at index 1 (i.e. skipping the first element).
# Step 5: In each iteration of the for loop, compare the current value to middle. If the value is smaller than middle, append the element to the smaller list. If the value is larger than middle, append the element to the larger list. This concludes the for loop.
# Step 6: Create a variable result which is the concatenation (for example, using + or .concat()) of:
# the return value of a recursive call to my_sort passing smaller as the parameter.
# a list containing only the value of middle.
# the return value of a recursive call to my_sort passing larger as the parameter.
# Step 7: return result
# Most of these steps are very straight-forward. Just make sure that the value you return is indeed a flat (non-nested) list of numbers. In other words: watch out not to append the return values of recursive calls as nested lists to your resulting value. The result value needs to be a concatenation of the three values described above, resulting in a single, 1-dimensional list. Also, ensure that you are not modifying the function signature and are using exactly the specified variable names and program structure!
